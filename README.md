# OAuth-github

Off-platform project on codecademy.
In this project, we implemented OAuth using the express-session module to manage user sessions authenticated using the passport module. We configured passport using the credentials from GitHub and implemented the URL routes for authentication. Finally, we implemented a middleware function to protect the route.
